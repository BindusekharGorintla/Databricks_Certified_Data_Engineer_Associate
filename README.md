# Databricks Certified Data Engineer Associate

This repository provides an overview of how to use and the benefits of the **Databricks Lakehouse Platform** and its tools. It is designed to help data engineers, analysts, and scientists understand the architecture, workflows, and best practices for building scalable data solutions.


## 🏗 Data Lakehouse
- **Architecture**: Combines the reliability of data warehouses with the scalability of data lakes.
- **Description**: Stores structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one unified platform.
- **Benefits**:
  - Simplifies data management.
  - Reduces duplication between lake and warehouse.
  - Enables advanced analytics and machine learning directly on lakehouse data.

## 💻 Data Science and Engineering Workspace
- **Clusters**: Elastic compute resources for running Spark jobs.
- **Notebooks**: Interactive environment for Python, SQL, R, and Scala.
- **Data Storage**: Unified access to cloud object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake, GCP Storage).

---

## 🔄 Delta Lake
- **Concepts**: Open-source storage layer providing ACID transactions on data lakes.
- **Table Management**: Create, update, and delete tables with reliability.
- **Optimizations**:
  - Time travel queries.
  - Schema enforcement and evolution.
  - Performance improvements with data skipping and Z-ordering.
